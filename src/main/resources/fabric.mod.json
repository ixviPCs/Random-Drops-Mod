This adds an exciting element of surprise to your world, whether you’re exploring, building, or mining.  Features Randomized Drops: Every block in the game can drop any item or block, creating endless surprises. Instant Shuffle: Use the /redrop command at any time to reshuffle all block drops, keeping gameplay unpredictable and fun.
